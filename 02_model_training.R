#' 02_Model_Training.R
#' 
#' This script performs machine learning model training and experimental design.
#' It covers the second phase of the lab practical:
#' Model Training and Experimental Design.
#'
#' Steps:
#' 1. Data Partitioning (Internal vs. External Validation)
#' 2. k-Fold Cross-Validation (Hyperparameter Tuning)
#' 3. Model Execution (Baseline: Logistic Regression)
#' 4. Model Execution (Non-linear: Random Forest)
#' 5. Parallelization for Speed

# Use multiple cores for training speed.
# Novice Tip: Training models can be computationally expensive. 
# Parallelization allows R to train multiple versions of the model simultaneously.

# 1. Load Preprocessed Data
input_file <- file.path(results_dir, "cleaned_data.rds")

  stop("Error: cleaned_data.rds not found. Run 01_data_preparation.R first.")

preproc_results <- readRDS(input_file)
dat <- preproc_results$dat_transformed

# 2. Model Training Strategy: Logistic Regression (glmnet)
# Novice Tip: Logistic regression with L2 regularization (Ridge) is a great baseline.
# It is fast, interpretable, and less prone to overfitting than complex models.
cat("\nStep 2: Training Logistic Regression (glmnet)...\n")
cat("Strategy: 80/20 Train-Test split, 5-fold Cross-Validation (repeated 100x)\n")

# run_ml() handles partitioning and CV automatically.
results_glmnet <- run_ml(
  dataset = dat,
  method = "glmnet",
  outcome_colname = "dx",
  seed = seed,
  cv_times = 2 # Reduced for the tutorial run; should be 100 in real research
)

# 3. Model Training Strategy: Random Forest (rf)
# Novice Tip: Random Forest is a non-linear ensemble method. It's robust 
# but can take much longer to train.
cat("\nStep 3: Training Random Forest (rf)...\n")
results_rf <- run_ml(
  dataset = dat,
  method = "rf",
  outcome_colname = "dx",

# 4. Inspecting Initial Results

cat("GLMNET Performance (Test Set AUC):", results_glmnet$performance$AUC, "\n")
cat("\nRF Performance (Internal CV AUC):", results_rf$performance$cv_metric_AUC, "\n")
cat("RF Performance (Test Set AUC):", results_rf$performance$AUC, "\n")

# Novice Tip: If CV AUC is 1.0 but Test AUC is 0.5, the model is OVERFITTING.
# It has memorized the training data but cannot generalize to new samples.

# 5. Save Model Results
