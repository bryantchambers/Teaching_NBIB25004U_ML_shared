# Lab Practical Plan: Machine Learning for Bioinformatics

## 1. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
*This stage ensures the raw biological data is transformed into a mathematically sound format that a model can interpret without bias.*

1. **Cleaning Names and Columns**: Remove special characters, spaces, and non-ASCII characters from headers. This prevents syntax errors in downstream R/Python functions that treat column names as variables.
2. **Standardizing Data Types**: Ensure numeric values are not stored as strings (characters). Machine learning models require quantitative inputs; a single "N/A" in a column can force the entire vector to become a character type, breaking the model.
3. **Assessing Data Completeness (Imputation)**:
    * **Median/Mean Imputation**: Replacing missing values with the average of the column.
    * **Zero/NA Replacement**: Deciding if an "NA" in bioinformatics (e.g., proteomics or transcriptomics) represents a true zero (below detection limit) or a missing observation.
4. **Redundant and Correlated Feature Removal**: Removing features that are highly correlated ($r > 0.90$). If two genes always vary together, keeping both provides no new info and can confuse model weights (Multicollinearity).
5. **Target Variable Curation**: Remove any observations (rows) that are missing the "Outcome" (Labels). A model cannot learn from a sample if it doesn't know the truth it is supposed to predict.
6. **Feature Variance Filtering**:
    * **Zero Variance**: Removing columns that are the same value for every sample.
    * **Near-Zero Variance**: Removing features with very few unique values or extremely skewed distributions, as they offer no predictive power.
7. **Data Normalization and Scaling**:
    * **Z-score Scaling**: Centering data so the mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1.
    * **Min-Max Scaling**: Squishing data between 0 and 1. This prevents features with large raw numbers (e.g., 5000 units) from dominating features with small numbers (e.g., 0.05 units).
8. **Categorical and Binary Data Handling**:
    * **One-Hot Encoding**: Converting "Wildtype/Mutant" into numeric 0 and 1.
    * **Dummy Variables**: Ensuring multi-level categories (e.g., Tissue Type: Lung, Heart, Liver) are represented numerically.

## 2. Model Training and Experimental Design
*This stage defines how we teach the model while ensuring we don't "overfit" (memorize the data).*

1. **Data Partitioning Strategy**:
    * **Training/Validation Split**: Holding out a portion (e.g., 20%) of data that the model never sees during training to test its real-world performance.
    * **k-Fold Cross-Validation**: Dividing data into $k$ groups (folds). The model trains on $k-1$ folds and tests on the remaining one, repeating this until every fold has been the "test" set. This ensures the results aren't a fluke of a lucky split.
    * **Exemplar Data/Downsampling**: Balancing classes if you have 1000 healthy samples but only 10 sick ones, ensuring the model doesn't just learn to guess "healthy" every time.
2. **Model Execution**:
    * **Algorithm Selection**: Choosing between Random Forest, XGBoost, or Support Vector Machines.
    * **Parallelization**: Using multiple CPU cores (via `mclapply` in R or `n_jobs` in Python) to speed up training on large genomic datasets.
3. **Inspecting Model Outputs**:
    * **Convergence**: Checking if the model actually finished learning.
    * **Probability Scores**: Looking at the raw confidence (e.g., "This sample is 85% likely to be Mutant") rather than just the final 0/1 label.

## 3. Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
*Evaluating if the model's predictions are reliable and useful for biological discovery.*

1. **Classification Performance**:
    * **ROC/AUC**: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. A score of 1.0 is perfect; 0.5 is as good as a coin flip. It measures performance across all classification thresholds.
    * **prAUC (Precision-Recall AUC)**: Often better for bioinformatics when classes are imbalanced (e.g., a rare disease).
2. **Clinical and Biological Utility**:
    * **Sensitivity (Recall)**: The ability to find all the "sick" samples. Crucial for medical screening.
    * **Specificity**: The ability to correctly identify "healthy" samples. Crucial for avoiding false alarms.
    * **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. High F1 means the model is balanced and not biased toward one error type.
    * **Confusion Matrix**: A table showing True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives.

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
*The "fine-tuning" phase to squeeze the best performance out of an algorithm.*

1. **Grid Search vs. Random Search**: Automatically testing different "knobs" on the model (e.g., the depth of a decision tree or the learning rate) to find the optimal combination.
2. **Overfitting Detection**: Monitoring if performance is great on training data but poor on validation data—a sign the model is memorizing noise rather than learning biology.

## 5. Biological Interpretation and Feature Importance
*Moving from a "black box" to understanding the actual biology learned by the model.*

1. **Feature Importance (Variable Importance)**: Ranking which genes, metabolites, or clinical markers were most influential in making the prediction.
2. **Biological Context**:
    * **Pathway Analysis**: Checking if the "important" genes belong to a specific biological pathway (e.g., inflammation).
    * **Directionality**: Understanding if a feature's increase or decrease leads to the predicted outcome.
3. **Latent Feature Review**: Checking if the model picked up on "Batch Effects" (e.g., samples from Lab A vs. Lab B) rather than actual biology.
